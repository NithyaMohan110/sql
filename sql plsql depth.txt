==============================================================================================================================================


Below are sample code snippets for various PL/SQL constructs. Each example is commented so you can see what it does. Feel free to modify these examples for your own needs.

---

## 1. Cursor Example

This anonymous block demonstrates how to declare and use an explicit cursor that fetches employee details from an `employees` table.

```sql
DECLARE
    -- Declare a cursor to select employee details
    CURSOR c_emp IS
        SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
        FROM employees;
    
    -- Variables to hold individual row values
    v_emp_id   employees.emp_id%TYPE;
    v_emp_name employees.emp_name%TYPE;
    v_salary   employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN c_emp;  -- Open the cursor
    LOOP
        FETCH c_emp INTO v_emp_id, v_emp_name, v_salary;
        EXIT WHEN c_emp%NOTFOUND;
        -- Process each row (here we just output to the console)
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee: ' || v_emp_name || ', Salary: ' || v_salary);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE c_emp;  -- Always close the cursor
END;
/
```

---

## 2. Procedure Example

This procedure updates an employee's salary by a given increase amount. It takes two parameters: the employee ID and the amount to add.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_salary (
    p_emp_id   IN NUMBER,
    p_increase IN NUMBER
) IS
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees
    SET salary = salary + p_increase
    WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;
    
    COMMIT;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
       ROLLBACK;
       -- Optionally, log or re-raise the error
       RAISE;
END;
/
```

*To execute this procedure:*

```sql
BEGIN
    update_salary(p_emp_id => 101, p_increase => 500);
END;
/
```

---

## 3. Trigger Example

This trigger prevents an update that would decrease an employee’s salary. It fires before any update to the `salary` column in the `employees` table.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_employee_update
BEFORE UPDATE OF salary ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :new.salary < :old.salary THEN
       -- Raise an error if the new salary is less than the current salary
       RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Salary cannot be decreased.');
    END IF;
END;
/
```

---

## 4. Function Example

This function returns the employee name given an employee ID. If no matching record is found, it returns a default message.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employee_name(p_emp_id IN NUMBER)
RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
    v_emp_name employees.emp_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT emp_name
    INTO v_emp_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;
    
    RETURN v_emp_name;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        RETURN 'Employee Not Found';
END;
/
```

*To call this function:*

```sql
DECLARE
   v_name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
   v_name := get_employee_name(101);
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name: ' || v_name);
END;
/
```

---

## 5. Package Example

Below is an example of a package that groups related routines. The package specification declares a procedure to increase an employee’s salary and a function to get the current salary. The package body provides their implementations.

### Package Specification

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE emp_pkg AS
   PROCEDURE raise_salary(p_emp_id IN NUMBER, p_amount IN NUMBER);
   FUNCTION get_salary(p_emp_id IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
END emp_pkg;
/
```

### Package Body

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY emp_pkg AS
  
   PROCEDURE raise_salary(p_emp_id IN NUMBER, p_amount IN NUMBER) IS
   BEGIN
      UPDATE employees
      SET salary = salary + p_amount
      WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;
      COMMIT;
   END raise_salary;
   
   FUNCTION get_salary(p_emp_id IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
      v_salary employees.salary%TYPE;
   BEGIN
      SELECT salary
      INTO v_salary
      FROM employees
      WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;
      RETURN v_salary;
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
         RETURN NULL;
   END get_salary;
   
END emp_pkg;
/
```

*Usage example:*

```sql
DECLARE
   v_current_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
   emp_pkg.raise_salary(p_emp_id => 101, p_amount => 1000);
   v_current_salary := emp_pkg.get_salary(p_emp_id => 101);
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updated Salary: ' || v_current_salary);
END;
/
```

---

## 6. REF CURSOR Example

This example shows how to declare a REF CURSOR type in a package and a procedure that returns a REF CURSOR with employee data.

### Package Specification with REF CURSOR

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE emp_refcur_pkg AS
   -- Define a REF CURSOR type
   TYPE ref_cursor_t IS REF CURSOR;
   
   -- Procedure to return all employees via a REF CURSOR
   PROCEDURE get_all_employees(p_cursor OUT ref_cursor_t);
END emp_refcur_pkg;
/
```

### Package Body

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY emp_refcur_pkg AS
   PROCEDURE get_all_employees(p_cursor OUT ref_cursor_t) IS
   BEGIN
      OPEN p_cursor FOR
         SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
         FROM employees;
   END get_all_employees;
END emp_refcur_pkg;
/
```

*Usage example:*

```sql
DECLARE
   cur_ref emp_refcur_pkg.ref_cursor_t;
   v_emp_id   employees.emp_id%TYPE;
   v_emp_name employees.emp_name%TYPE;
   v_salary   employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
   -- Call the procedure to open the REF CURSOR
   emp_refcur_pkg.get_all_employees(cur_ref);
   
   -- Loop through the returned cursor
   LOOP
       FETCH cur_ref INTO v_emp_id, v_emp_name, v_salary;
       EXIT WHEN cur_ref%NOTFOUND;
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ID: ' || v_emp_id || ', Name: ' || v_emp_name || ', Salary: ' || v_salary);
   END LOOP;
   CLOSE cur_ref;
END;
/
```
